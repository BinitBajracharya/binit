	The HTML p element represents a paragraph. Paragraphs are usually represented in visual media as blocks of text separated from adjacent blocks by blank lines and/or first-line indentation, but HTML paragraphs can be any structural grouping of related content, such as images or form fields.
	
	The hr tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page (e.g. a shift of topic). The hr element is most often displayed as a horizontal rule that is used to separate content (or define a change) in an HTML page

	<hr>
	<p><blockquote>The HTML blockquote Element (or HTML Block Quotation Element) indicates that the enclosed text is an extended quotation. Usually, this is rendered visually by indentation (see Notes for how to change it)
